# Main
- Add decode/encode functions, attached to class (When class is made), and lone. Eliminating the need for the class, though, the class can be quite useful.
- Ability to decode/encode symbols, such as ',', '.', '/' etc..

# Set Aside 
- Make Class
- Better Security
- - Such as a password needed to use the "decode" function.
