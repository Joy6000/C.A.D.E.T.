# C.A.D.E.T. 
- Customizable Advanced Decoder and Encoder Tool
###### Thanks to koalabeast5556#5930 For the A in C.A.D.E.T.
## What does this do?
So far a simple (and misleading, as of right now) Encoder and Decoder tool. For now it only supports letters, no decoding and encoding functions, really bare. No use in downloading the code as of right now.
## When is it available to NPM?
When it's ready.
No real ETA yet. It's sort've in early Alpha state as of right now.
